**:warning: WARNING: TWBase is under development and not yet ready for production üêû**

## Recommended Modules

As TWBase Theme use [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) I recommends you to install [TWBase Theme Utilities](https://github.com/drupix/twbase_utils) modules with this theme. It load the `styles.css` provided by **TWBase Theme** and add the `prose` (`tw-prose`) extra class to the editor `body` to reflects the frontend while editing node in admin section. Otherwise the content in your editor may look slightly poor and naked... üôÄ. The module also provide an admin interface to control the frontpage showcase content and last but not least: it allows you to define showcase and related options per content type ü•≥.

## Demo

A very [basic demo](https://twbase-theme.drupal-solutions.ch/) is available ~~with the [TWBase Theme Utilities](https://github.com/drupix/twbase_utils) modules installed~~.

## CSS compilation

### Development compilation

To **watch** changes while *"playing"* with `css` and html `class`, run  **`npm run watch`** from theme root directory.

### Building for production

By default, for development purpose the outputed css file is not minified. To minify it, uncomment `cssnano` in the plugins section of `postcss.config.js` :

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-import': {},
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
    //Uncomment this to minify the outputed css file
//     cssnano: {
//       preset: "default",
//     },
  }
}
```

When you're happy with all this, **build** the final css file by running the command **`npm run build`** from theme root directory.
